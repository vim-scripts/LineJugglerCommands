DESCRIPTION
Most of the line manipulation mappings of the LineJuggler.vim plugin can
also be done with built-in Ex commands like :move, :put, etc. This plugin
adds those commands that do not exist (in a simple form) as built-in commands.
Sometimes, a command is just more practical (e.g. in a script), more
repeatable (from the command-line history), or offers different line
addressing.
Namely, this plugin provides a :Swap command to exchange two ranges of
lines.

SEE ALSO
- This plugin is based on the functionality of the (required) LineJugger.vim
  plugin (vimscript #4140), which offers many mappings to quickly duplicate
  and move lines to above / below the current line.

USAGE
:[range]Swap {range}    Exchange the current line / line(s) given by [range]
                        with the lines in {range}.

:[range]Replace {range} Replace the current line / line(s) given by [range]
                        with the lines in {range}.
