DESCRIPTION
Most of the line manipulation mappings of the LineJuggler.vim plugin can
also be done with built-in Ex commands like :move, :put, etc. This plugin
adds those commands that do not exist (in a simple form) as built-in commands.
Sometimes, a command is just more practical (e.g. in a script), more
repeatable (from the command-line history), or offers different line
addressing.
Namely, this plugin provides a :Swap command to exchange two ranges of
lines (or with a register), and a similar :Replace command.

SOURCE
Inspired by the following Stack Overflow question:

SEE ALSO
- This plugin is based on the functionality of the (required) LineJugger.vim
  plugin (vimscript #4140), which offers many mappings to quickly duplicate
  and move lines to above / below the current line.
- ReplaceWithRegister.vim (vimscript #2703) provides normal and visual mode
  gr commands that are similar to the :Replace Ex command.

USAGE
:[range]Swap {range}    Exchange the current line / line(s) given by [range]
                        with the lines in {range}.
:[range]Swap [["]x]     Exchange the current line / line(s) given by [range]
                        with the text from register [x]. This always works
                        linewise, like a combination of :delete [x] and
                        :put.

:[range]Replace {range} Replace the current line / line(s) given by [range]
                        with the lines in {range}.
:[range]Replace [["]x]
                        Replace the current line / line(s) given by [range]
                        with the text from register [x]. This always works
                        linewise, like a combination of :delete and
                        :put.

                        Note: To use one of the numbered registers 1-9, you
                        need to prepend the optional double quotes ("1 - "9),
                        in order to disambiguate them from the absolute lines
                        1 - 9.
